# ✅ DATA TYPES:
"""
As we disscuss earlier that variables store some piece of information/data.
So that data will have any type for itself.we call that type a data type.
Python has some built in data types for variables.


✅ Type	                                    ✅ Description 	                     ✅ Example
int	                                        Integer (whole numbers)                    x = 10
float	                                  Floating-point number (decimal)	          y = 3.14
complex	                                      Complex numbers	                     z = 2 + 3j
bool	                                    Boolean (True or False)	                  a = True
